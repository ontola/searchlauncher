Summary: Search everything—apps, web, and shortcuts—instantly.

  SearchLauncher transforms how you navigate your device. It replaces browsing with instant, keyboard-centric searching.

  * **Search Everything:** Instantly find apps, shortcuts, contacts, and device settings.
  * **Web Integration:** Search directly on YouTube, Google, Maps, Spotify, and more.
  * **Productivity Tools:** Built-in calculator, text snippets for quick pasting, and custom intent shortcuts (e.g., toggle flashlight).
  * **Smart & Fast:** Apps are sorted by usage for quick access. The interface is lightweight and designed for speed.
  * **Flexible Usage:** Use it as your primary **Launcher**, a powerful **Home Screen Widget**, or an **Overlay** accessible with a swipe from any app.
  * **Customization:** Set your personal background, add widgets, and enjoy full dark mode support.
